        1. it focus on Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction
        
        2. class are like artitecture structure to show the blueprint for example you see all the wall as a class within in it
        you can say its a popcorn wall with grey paint as object 
        
        3. Encapsulation-- focus on creating class and objec. inheritance-- manipluate individually inside the
        parent (the child element). polymorphism-- including all the class manipluate at once. abstraction-- handling the complexity by hiding unnecessary details 
        
        4. vehicle as a parent class than children are car, truck, motorcycle than set attribute each wheels and horsepower

        6. 
        
        7. it to create and setting attribute inside the object for example the class is a person and you would implement it as object such as name and age
        
        8. it has the ability to manipluate all at once for example shape as a class but the object are triangle circle or any other shape but it only manipluate shape nothing else >
